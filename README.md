# Wishlist App

The aim for this project was to create a helpful CRUD app using the Vue.js framework. 

As an alternative to the user having to create an account to enable them to save their wishlist, I took advantage of HTML5's Web Storage to automatically store the user's data whenever changes are made. This enables seamless, constant storage of the user's data that persists even if the browser is closed.
